## Submitting a pull request

1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure and install the dependencies:
```npm install```.
3. Make sure the tests pass on your machine: ```npm test```, note: these tests also apply the linter, so there's no need to lint separately.
4. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`. Please note that your branch name should not be a 'named' branch but rather a feature based branch so that other developers are able to tell what it does without having to constantly ask you. Please make the name as descriptive as possible for what it is doing.
5. Make your change, add <a href="">tests(following this model)</a>, and make sure all the tests still pass.
6. Push to your branch and open a pull request to the dev branch. In your pull request description, please describe what it is you have changed. A simple template to build upon for pull requests is available <a href="pull_request_template.md">here</a>
7. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and mergedðŸ˜„.
8. In some cases, your code may be rejected and you may thus need to fix your code before pushing to your pull request.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Follow the <a href="https://standardjs.com/">style</a> which is using standard. Any linting errors should be shown when running `npm test`.
- Write and update tests.
- Keep your changes as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a <a href="http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html">good commit message</a>.

Work in Progress pull requests are also welcome to get feedback early on, or if there is something blocked you. This simply means, you can draft a pull request just to met other developers to make sure you are on the right track before eventually converting it to a full pull request.
