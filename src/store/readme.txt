The global store should live here.

Normally we would use redux: https://redux.js.org/ for global store of objects but since this project is small, 
we shall be using zustand: https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/, and it's syntax is much easier to write and deal with.
We can use the store for storing the JWT for auth'd users
